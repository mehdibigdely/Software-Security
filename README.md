# Software-Security
Project report completed in the CS-305-H7563 Software Security class @ SNHU
This project was completed based on Artemis Financial request which is a consulting firm focusing on individualized financial plans for their customers. They asked us to work on the security of their public web application and to safeguard the sensitive personal and financial data. 
It took a while, but I was able to setup Tomcat server, and connect it successfully to the certificate that was created using Keytool. Setting up the Tomcat server was challenging at the beginning, but after understanding the way it works, I was able to easily change the setting and run it using differentparameters. 
To make certain the code and software application were functional and secure, I checked different texts to see their hashed outputs, and also tried to open the /hash or checkSum directories using http (which did not load), while was able to load the page using https protocol. 
I am excited to use the Tomcat server in combination with the Keytool and other certificate management application to deploy various Java application securely.
